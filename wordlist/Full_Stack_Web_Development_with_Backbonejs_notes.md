##Preface
1. If your JavaScript programming skills are a bit __rusty__, entering client-side application development can be a daunting adventure.
2. If you want to understand where Backbone.js and JavaScript __fit__ in your __technolgoy stack__, this book is for you.
##Chapter 1. The Bigger Picture
1. This can be interesting for certain kinds of applications, as we can share the same logic to __render__ views or validate models on the server as in the browser.
2. The important point right now is devising a way to require local modules from an application directory.
##Chapter 2. Kick-Starting Application Development
1. Before coding, it is advisable to start with a sketch of an interface on paper.
2. After this discussion, we create a __preliminary mock-up__ of how the user experience for browsing movies should look (Figure 2-2). 
3. We also can use the difference between __singular and plural__ words to indicate wheth‚Äê er we work with a collection or a model.
4. The state of a collection was __silently mutated__.
5. Based on the __wireframe__ of Munich Cinema, an important principle of Backbone.js was explained: decoupling state from the user interface.
##Chapter 3. Building the User Interface
1. Sometimes, you will see the use of ev.preventDefault() to stop the default event propagation. 
##Chapter 10. Automated Workflows
1. Most tools for workflow automation are actually framework __agnostic__, but a number of tools are repeatedly discussed in the Backbone ecosystem
