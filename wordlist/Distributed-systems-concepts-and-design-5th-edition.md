##1. CHARACTERIZATION OF DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
1. This definition leads to the following especially significant characteristics of distributed systems: concurrency of components, lack of a __global clock__ and independent failures of components.
2. Computers that are connected by a network may be __spatially__ separated by any distance.
3. The figure also provides an initial insight into the wide range of applications in use today, from relatively localized systems (as found, for example, in a car or aircraft) to global- scale systems involving millions of nodes, from __data-centric__ services to processor- intensive tasks, from systems built from very small and relatively primitive sensors to those incorporating powerful computational elements, from embedded systems to ones that support a sophisticated interactive user experience, and so on.
4. The growth of eCommerce as __exemplified__ by companies such as Amazon and eBay, and underlying payments technologies such as PayPal;
5. the emergence of digital libraries and the large-scale __digitization__ of legacy information sources such as books (for example, Google Books);
6. Other challenges include the real-time __propagation__ of events to the many players and maintaining a consistent view of the shared world.
7. Perhaps surprisingly, the largest online game, EVE Online, utilises a client-server architecture where a single copy of the state of the world is maintained on a __centralized__ server and accessed by client programs running on players’ consoles or other devices.
8. This used to be a manual process but competitive pressures have led to increasing automation in terms of what is known as __Complex Event Processing (CEP)__, which offers a way of composing event occurrences together into logical, temporal or spatial patterns.
9. __Internet Service Providers (ISPs)__ are companies that provide broadband links and other types of connection to individual users and small organizations, enabling them to access services anywhere in the Internet as well as providing local services such as email and web hosting.
10. A __backbone__ is a network link with a high transmission capacity, employing satellite connections, fibre optic cables and other high-bandwidth circuits.
11. Firewalls can also be problematic in distributed systems by __impeding__ legitimate access to services when resource sharing between internal and external users is required.
12. __Handheld devices__, including mobile phones, smart phones, GPS-enabled devices, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), video cameras and digital cameras.
13. __Wearable devices__, such as smart watches with functionality similar to a PDA.
14. The main challenge applying to such situations is to make __interoperation__ fast and convenient (that is, __spontaneous__) even though the user is in an environment they may never have visited before.
15. That means enabling the visitor’s device to communicate on the host network, and associating the device with suitable local services – a process called __service discovery__.
16. Note that this technology is __revolutionary__ in challenging manufacturers to rethink many consumer devices.
17. Distributed multimedia applications such as __webcasting__ place considerable demands on the underlying distributed infrastructure in terms of:
18. At one end of the __spectrum__, a user may opt for a remote storage facility for file storage requirements (for example, for multimedia data such as photographs, music or video) and/or for backups.
19. Possible models include remote object invocation, __remote event notification__, remote SQL access and distributed transaction processing.
20. Another security problem is that a user may wish to __disrupt a service__ for some reason. This can be achieved by bombarding the service with such a large number of pointless requests that the serious users are unable to use it. This is called a __denial of service attack__.
