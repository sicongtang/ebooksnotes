##Preface
1. Once the walls are up, we move into the __aesthetic elements__ like navbars, breadcrumbs, and media objects.
2. After that, we move on to the JavaScript elements, such as dropdowns, the __carousel__, and __modals__, that provide the interaction for a site.
3. The authors, Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto, have been __meticulous__ in providing examples of the codebase, HTML code samples, and more to kickstart your project.
##Chapter 1. Bootstrap Scaffolding
1. __Minified__ versions of the CSS and JavaScript are also included.
2. __For the sake of brevity__, I use the uncompressed version during development and then switch to the compressed version in production.
3. __Responsive design__ is a method for taking all of the existing content that is on the page and optimizing it for the device that is viewing it. 
4. Tablets get an optimized layout, taking advantage of their __portrait__ or __landscape__ layouts. 
5. To target these different widths, Bootstrap uses __CSS media queries__ to measure the width of the browser viewport and then, using conditionals, changes which parts of the stylesheets are loaded. 
6. Perhaps you have a really nice header on the main layout, but on mobile you want to __pare it down__, leaving only a few of the elements.
