##Introduction
1. The purpose of this book is to teach __solid idiomatic__ Go programming using all the features the language provides, as well as the most commonly used Go packages from Go’s standard library.
2. The book’s __key aim is to teach__ the Go language, and although many of the standard Go packages are used, not all of them are. 
3. On November 10, 2009, Go was __publicly unveiled__ under a liberal open source license.
4. The __lightning-fast compilation__ speed is made possible to a small extent because the language is easy to parse
5. Go uses a very clean and easy-to-understand syntax that avoids the __complexity and verbosity__ of older languages like C++ (first released in 1983) or Java (first released in 1995).
6. The Go compiler and runtime system takes care of the __tedious bookkeeping__.
7. __though__, Go’s approach to object orientation is __radically__ different from, say, C++, Java, or Python
##Chapter 1. An Overview in Five Examples
1. this uses Go’s __introspection__ facilities (from the re- flect package) to discover the types of the items it is asked to print.
