##Netty and Java NIO APIs
1. It achieves this by abstracting away the complexity involved and by providing an easy-to-use API that decouples business-logic from the network-handling code. 
2. It explains how to use fundamental Java networking APIs, discusses both its strengths and weaknesses, and shows how Netty addresses Java issues, such as the Epoll bug or memory leaks.
3. With Netty, "quick and easy" doesn't mean that a resulting application suffers from maintainability or performance issues.
4. In addition to the features listed, Netty also ships workarounds for known bugs/limitations in Java's NIO, so you don't need to hassle with them.
